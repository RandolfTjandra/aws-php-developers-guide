   :description: How to  create, list, and delete Amazon SNS topics, and to handle topic attributes using the AWS SDK for PHP version 3.
   :keywords: Amazon SNS topics for PHP

To send notifications to |SQS|, HTTP/S, email, |SMS|, or |LAM|, first create a topic that will deliver messages to to any subscribers of a topic.  

Learn more about subscribing to topics in :doc:`sns-examples-subscribing-unsubscribing-topics`


The following example shows how to:

* Creates a topic to which notifications can be published using :aws-php-class:`CreateTopic <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#createtopic>`.
* Returns a list of the requester's topics using :aws-php-class:`ListTopics <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#listtopic>`.
* Deletes a topic and all its subscriptions using :aws-php-class:`DeleteTopic <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#deletetopic>`.
* Returns all of the properties of a topic using :aws-php-class:`GetTopicAttributes <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#gettopicattributes>`.
* Allows a topic owner to set an attribute of the topic to a new value using :aws-php-class:`SetTopicAttributes <api-sns-2010-03-31.html#settopicattributes>`.

Creating a Topic
==========================

Pass the Name for the new topic to the createTopic method of the AWS.SNS client class. To call the createTopic method, create a promise for invoking an |SNS| service object, passing the parameters object. Then handle the response in the promise callback. The data returned by the promise contains the ARN of the topic.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/sns/CreateTopic.php
   :lines: 19-22
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sns/CreateTopic.php
   :lines: 31-50
   :language: php

Listing Your Topics
==========================

Create an empty object to pass to the listTopics method of the AWS.SNS client class. To call the listTopics method, create a promise for invoking an |SNS| service object, passing the parameters object. Then handle the response in the promise callback. The data returned by the promise contains an array of your topic ARNs.

   :lines: 31-50
   :language: php

Deleting a Topic
==========================

Create an object containing the TopicArn of the topic to delete to pass to the deleteTopic method of the AWS.SNS client class. To call the deleteTopic method, create a promise for invoking an |SNS| service object, passing the parameters object. Then handle the response in the promise callback.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/sns/DeleteTopic.php
   :lines: 19-22
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sns/DeleteTopic.php
   :lines: 31-50
   :language: php
   
Getting Topic Attributes
==========================

Create an object containing the TopicArn of a topic to delete to pass to the getTopicAttributes method of the AWS.SNS client class. To call the getTopicAttributes method, create a promise for invoking an |SNS| service object, passing the parameters object. Then handle the response in the promise callback.

**Imports**

.. literalinclude::  example_code/sns/GetTopicAttributes.php
   :lines: 19-22
   :language: PHP

**Sample Code**

.. literalinclude:: example_code/sns/GetTopicAttributes.php
   :lines: 31-50
   :language: php
   
Setting Topic Attributes
==========================

Create an object containing the parameters for the attribute update, including the TopicArn of the topic whose attributes you want to set, the name of the attribute to set, and the new value for that attribute. You can set only the Policy, DisplayName, and DeliveryPolicy attributes. Pass the parameters to the setTopicAttributes method of the AWS.SNS client class. To call the setTopicAttributes method, create a promise for invoking an |SNS| service object, passing the parameters object. Then handle the response in the promise callback.
